# final-work-ldeas

in my final project, I want to design a small car and I can use remote control or bluetooth to control the movement of the car.
there's a movement sensor ( change the pressure sensot to a movement sensor) on the small car, so I can get the value of the movement from the car. 

For my concept, this car can move and can be control by person. I want to use wireless stuff to get the value from the arduino board and express the value to processing. I want to use processing to make some visualization things. I think I will keep the red jumbo to see the situation of the car and the connection.
